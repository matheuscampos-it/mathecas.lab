## 🧪 About The Project

`mathecas.lab` serves as both a creative outlet and a dynamic portfolio. Each "experiment" is a small project designed to be engaging, sometimes thought-provoking, and often a little bit quirky. The goal is to explore different web technologies, flex creative muscles, and share some interactive fun with the world.

This project is built with a passion for learning and a love for interactive web experiences.

## 💡 Current & Planned Experiments

Here's a sneak peek at some of the interactive experiences you'll find (or will soon find!) in the lab:

* **🌌 Cosmic Sloth Oracle:**
    * **Status:** In Development
    * **Description:** Seek profoundly lazy (yet insightful) wisdom from the stars. What does the universe have in store for your nap time?
* **🎶 Accidental Melodies:**
    * **Status:** Planned
    * **Description:** Become an unintentional composer. Click around and see what sonic accidents you can create.
* **🤔 Daily "What If?":**
    * **Status:** Planned
    * **Description:** Explore absurd choices for everyday situations and their hilariously unpredictable outcomes.
* **🔬 Gallery of Tiny/Huge Things:**
    * **Status:** Planned
    * **Description:** An interactive journey through scale, from the unimaginably small to the cosmically vast.

...and more to come as inspiration strikes!
